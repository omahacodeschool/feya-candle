<h1>About Feya Candles</h1>

<p>Inspired by the love of family and the love of food, Feya began in Lincoln, NE as a way to honor my aunt and grandmother who taught me how to share happiness and love by making great food.  Now their love may live on forever – with every Feya purchase we hand deliver a meal to a child in need.  Join me as we feed the World!</p>
